# Introduction

Deno is a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with secure defaults and a great developer experience.

It's built on V8, Rust, and Tokio.

## Feature highlights

- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access (unless explicitly enabled).
- Supports TypeScript out of the box.
- Ships a single executable (deno).
- Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code formatter (deno fmt).
- Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work with Deno.
- Scripts can be bundled into a single JavaScript file.
